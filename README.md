# Magic Square

I made this project mostly to become better at python. My goals are:

* use a generator
* use type hints and mypy type checking
* implement profiling
* optionally: try out `virtenv`
* optionally: find a magic square (of squares??)

## Type checking

Just run `mypy` like so:

```
mypy magic_square_finder.py
```
